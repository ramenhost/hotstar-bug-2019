## JWT tampering
Most of the API endpoints don't check for the JWT signature. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to login as any email user, without password.  
**Information leakage:** Watch history

## Premium or VIP API mocking
Only the following API endpoints check for JWT signature and their responses can be mocked in a MITM proxy.
- refresh-token
- entitlement/content (dummy cache key)
- entitlement/device

## Play API
This needs a valid cache key to be sent in the header which we can only be obtained from actual `entitlement/conten` API. However removing the cache key header completely from the request (can be done in a MITM proxy) allows streaming of the content.
